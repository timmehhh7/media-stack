# Fully Dockerized Media-Stack

This main purpose of this project is to provide an easy, distributable, set of containers run in Docker, for the purposes of finding, downloading, and playing Media files.

## Built With

The project consists of a docker-compose file utilizing the following opensource software components:

 * [nzbget](https://nzbget.net) - Downloader for usenet
 * [sonarr](https://sonarr.tv) - Searcher and handler for TV episodes
 * [radarr](https://radarr.video) - Searcher and handler for Movies
 * [plex](https://www.plex.tv) - Media Management for multiple devices etc
 * [plexpy](https://jonnywong16.github.io/plexpy/) - Monitoring and tracking information for Plex

Each of these is fully containerized and easily setup, with some simple volume and network configurations.

## Requirements

 1. A host machine running Docker - I use an Ubuntu installation on a Mac Mini
 2. Docker and Docker Compose
 3. Git
 4. Somewhere to store Media files and configurations - I use a NAS and connect over NFS
 5. My current setup uses the Plexpass tagged container for Plex - If you do NOT have Plexpass you may need to use an alternative image

## Installing

 * Install Docker on your machine
 * Clone this repository - `git clone https://github.com/arctiqtim/media-stack`
 * Ensure you've setup your Media store

## Configuration

 * Edit the `docker-compose.yml` file in the cloned repo accordingly - **Most Importantly** edit the volume mappings
 * Ensure all volume mounts are customized - **For Plex you need a non-NAS mount point for its configuration files**
 * Customize network ports accordingly - This default setup uses ports 27020, 27021, 27022, and 27023
 * Customize User and Group IDs according to your Media storage setup.  The defaults in the included file may work
 * You can tunnel to your running linux machine via SSH as follows:
 `ssh user@server -L 27020:<IP of Docker Host>:27020 -L 27021:<IP of Docker Host>:27021 -L 27022:<IP of Docker Host>:27022 -L 27023:<IP of Docker Host>:27023 -N`

In order to ensure the Sonarr and Radarr containers can find downloaded media from Nzbget properly you need to configure them as follows:

### Sonarr Configuration - Advanced Settings in "Download Client"
